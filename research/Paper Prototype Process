I ran this paper prototype test on a coworker. He read the user story/flow that it is based on before beginning. The user flow is to update the profile picture. 
First thing he did was tap the hamburger menu in the top right corner. This led to the menu page where he tapped the avatar icon. This led to the profile page, and he tapped the "edit profile" icon. After tapping the edit option, two modules appear. The first, relating to where to select the photo from. The second module appear was the app asking permission to access the photos. He then selected "camera roll" and proceeded to select a photo. This led to the "edit photo" page where the user crops an image to fit within the boundaries. He then selected "choose" and was directed back to the profile page.
